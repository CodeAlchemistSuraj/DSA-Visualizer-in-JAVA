This folder contains algorithm implementations added programmatically for the DSA Visualizer project.

Files:
- MergeSort.java, QuickSort.java, HeapSort.java
- InsertionSort.java, SelectionSort.java, BinarySearchUtil.java
- DFS.java, TopologicalSort.java, BellmanFord.java
- UnionFind.java, BST.java, HeapUtils.java

These are algorithm-only utilities (no UI). They are intended to be used by visualizer controllers to provide stepwise visualization.
